		<p>About Me</p>
	</div>
		
		<p>I am Samuel Martín Randall, an 18 year old university student currently studying Game Design at Bournemouth University, formerly going to Collingwood College as my secondary school and going to Farnborough Sixth Form as my sixth form.</p>

		<p>I have been making games since I was very young, most notably making card games. More recently, however, I have assisted a friend in the development of character kits in a MOBA game and I have begun the planning of a unique strategical FPS in my own time. Though balancing and mechanics/dynamics are where my passion lies, the enjoyment of other ideas such as storyline, character aesthetics (visuals, audio, lore etc.) is also very much present.</p>
